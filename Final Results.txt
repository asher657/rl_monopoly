#### AGENT WIN RATE ####
### Random vs DQN ###
Random Average Wins: 0.16
DQN Average Wins: 0.44
Win Rate Lift: 168.10%
Z-Score: -13.36983
p-value: 0.00000
Null Hypothesis: DQN Agent win rate is similar to the Random Agent
Alternate Hypothesis: DQN Agent win rate is different from the Random Agent
0.00000 < 0.5, therefore reject the null hypothesis


### Baseline vs DQN ###
Baseline Average Wins: 0.04
DQN Average Wins: 0.44
Win Rate Lift: 893.18%
Z-Score: -20.56156
p-value: 0.00000
Null Hypothesis: DQN Agent win rate is similar to the Baseline Agent
Alternate Hypothesis: DQN Agent win rate is different from the Baseline Agent
0.00000 < 0.5, therefore reject the null hypothesis

p-value: 0.00000
Null Hypothesis: DQN Agent rewards are similar to the Random Agent
Alternate Hypothesis: DQN Agent rewards are different from the Random Agent
0.00000 < 0.5, therefore reject the null hypothesis
